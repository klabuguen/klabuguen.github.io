Happy 2025! Today's the first day of this wonderful new year, and I wanted to challenge myself by attempting to commit to committing every single day.<br><br>
# Commit to Committing... ?
Every single day this year, I will push code to one of my project repositories and/or review important embedded software related concepts, then write about it in this blog. 

<br>I'm really looking forward to how much progress I'll be able to make in a year!
